Scenario analysis in finance is a process used to assess the potential outcomes of an investment or financial decision by considering a range of possible future scenarios. This approach helps in understanding the risks and rewards associated with different economic conditions, market movements, and other factors that could affect the performance of an investment portfolio.


Portfolio Expected Return (E[R])
The expected return of a portfolio is a weighted average of the expected returns of the individual assets in the portfolio. If a portfolio consists of n assets, each with an expected return R_i and a weight w_i in the portfolio, the expected return E[R] of the portfolio is given by:
E[R] = sum(w_i * E[R_i]) for i = 1 to n
Where:
w_i is the weight of the i-th asset in the portfolio.
E[R_i] is the expected return of the i-th asset.

Covariance Matrix (Cov)
The covariance matrix measures how different assets in the portfolio move relative to each other. The covariance between two assets i and j is denoted as Cov(R_i, R_j) and represents the degree to which the returns of the two assets change together. For a portfolio with n assets, the covariance matrix Cov is an n x n matrix where each element Cov(R_i, R_j) is defined as:
Cov(R_i, R_j) = E[(R_i - E[R_i]) * (R_j - E[R_j])]

Portfolio Variance (Var[R])
The variance of the portfolio's return is a measure of the portfolio's total risk and is calculated using the covariance matrix and the portfolio weights. The portfolio variance Var[R] is given by:
Var[R] = sum(w_i * w_j * Cov(R_i, R_j)) for i, j = 1 to n
Where:
w_i and w_j are the weights of the i-th and j-th assets, respectively.
Cov(R_i, R_j) is the covariance between the returns of assets i and j.

Portfolio Standard Deviation (Std[R])
The standard deviation of the portfolio's return, also known as the portfolio's volatility, is the square root of the portfolio variance:
Std[R] = sqrt(Var[R])


Scenario analysis involves evaluating how the portfolio's expected return, variance, and standard deviation would change under different hypothetical scenarios. Each scenario represents a different set of market conditions, which could include changes in asset returns and covariances. For example, scenarios might represent a "Bull Market," "Bear Market," or "Stagnant Market."

Given m scenarios, each scenario s provides a set of expected returns R_i^s and a covariance matrix Cov^s. For each scenario, the portfolio's expected return, variance, and standard deviation are calculated as follows:

Scenario Expected Return (E[R^s]):
E[R^s] = sum(w_i * R_i^s) for i = 1 to n

Scenario Portfolio Variance (Var[R^s]):
Var[R^s] = sum(w_i * w_j * Cov^s(R_i, R_j)) for i, j = 1 to n

Scenario Portfolio Standard Deviation (Std[R^s]):
Std[R^s] = sqrt(Var[R^s])

Scenario analysis is used in various aspects of finance, such as:
1) To assess the potential losses or gains under different market conditions.
2) To evaluate the potential performance of different investment strategies.
3) To test the resilience of a portfolio under extreme or unlikely conditions.
